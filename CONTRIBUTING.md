# Contributing to Listz

First of all: thank you for your intrest in contributing to Listz! 🎉

## Creating a new Listz

If you have a nice idea of a collection to add, you can request a new Listz repository here. When a new Listz repository is created, it is automatically added to the [master list](https://github.com/listz/listz-all) and linked to our CI tools.

## Updating an existing Listz

If you think that an existing Listz is lacking content, you can always fork the repo, edit the content and send a pull request. Before doing so, please run the [test command](https://github.com/listz/listz-template#how-to-use) so that your changes do not break the working version.
